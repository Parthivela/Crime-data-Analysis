# Crime-data-Analysis
This  project focuses on analyzing crime data from the US based on geographical locations. Using Python and the PyMySQL library, we interact with a MySQL database to import, explore, and derive insights from the dataset. 
The dataset includes fields such as DR NO, Date Reported, Date Occurred, Area Name, Crime Code, Crime Code Description, Victim Age, Victim Sex, Premises Description, Status, Location, Latitude, and Longitude 
It helps in understanding patterns, trends, and factors influencing crime rates in different locations.
